Everyone loves watching movies these days. If we talk about what makes a movie successful, then we would think of a compelling story line, a well written script, talented editors, photographers, videographers, etc. People will also watch a movie if it is a particular genre but something that is even more important is the actor. Almost everyone even has a favorite actor and/or actress. Some people will watch a movie if it has their factor actor but no matter how the script is. For example, Dwayne Johnson, Will Smith, Tom Holland, Jennifer Lawrence, etc. are very popular actors and people will go watch a movie as long as one of these actors are playing a role in the movie. That being said, you may have seen your favorite actor in many movies and maybe that is why they are your favorite. But the real question is, are all the movies that you love, and your favorite actor connected somehow? Well in this project I will explore the connection between the movies and the actors using different graph theories and see if there are any connections.
